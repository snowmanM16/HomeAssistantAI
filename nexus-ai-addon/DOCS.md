- "When does the sun set today?"
- "Remember that I prefer the temperature at 68 degrees at night"
- "Create an automation to turn off all lights when I leave home"

### Automation Management

Nexus AI will detect patterns in your usage and suggest automations. You can:

- View, accept, or dismiss suggested automations
- Manage existing automations
- Ask Nexus AI to create custom automations

### Memory Management

Nexus AI maintains a memory of your preferences and important information:

- View and edit stored memories
- Manually add important information
- Set user preferences that Nexus AI should remember

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure your Home Assistant URL is correct and accessible from the add-on.
- Verify your long-lived access token is valid and has the necessary permissions.

### AI Processing Issues
